Instructions for use:

My processing sketch consists of an environment like space. There are a continuous stream of new stars that reproduced then shortly after fading away. I included dials and speedometers similar to that of a spaceship. On the bottom left I made a fuel gauge which decreases as the user accelerates. The speedometers that I have positioned at the top left and bottom of the sketch also increase as the spaceship moves. The user can accelerate using the wad controls. A has the slowest acceleration whilst d has the greatest. A hyperspace type sound plays as the user holds the 'd' key whilst the stars are produced much faster than the normal rate so that the user appears to be travelling through time. 

Description of how I coded my assignment:

Firstly I established what my basic background was going to be. I eventually decided to go with stars and a space theme for my project. I was able to produce the stars by calling a class Stars then accessing it through void setup(). After I was happy with my background, I laid out on paper what objects and images I wanted to display to the user. I then coded my assignment according, starting with one object at a time. I then began coding the radar which I have positioned at the bottom right of the display. This was then followed by the fuel gauge and the speedometers. The object which I am most proud of would be the speedometer dials at the bottom of the display as they had to be produced with various counters so that the dial would increase in proportion to the speed the user decides to go. They also drop back to zero revolutions when the user releases the key pressed. An if statement and a counter was used to display the message 'You are out of fuel' when the fuel gauge becomes empty and allow the user to refuel by pressing the spacebar.
